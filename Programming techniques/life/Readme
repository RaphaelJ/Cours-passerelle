The three directories (c, haskell and java) contain the sources for the three
implementations.

Each directories contains a compile.sh file which contains the command to
compile the executable.

The script used to benchmark each method for each implementation is named
bench.sh.

The usage for the C sequential implementation is :
./life <board size>

The usage for the Haskell implementation is :
./Life +RTS -N<# of threads> -A15m

The usage for the Java implementation is :
java Life <board size> <# of threads>

The Java's sequential generator is only executed if <# of threads> is one.
The Java's block generator is only executed if <# of threads> is a square
(1, 4, 9, 16, etc).
The Java's one-thread-per-cell generator is only executed if <board size> is
lesser that 50.
